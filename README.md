👋 Hi, I’m @lzsouza
👀 I’m interested in exploring new technologies with a focus on automation, cultivating a DevOps culture, and simplifying processes for efficient software development.
🌱 I’m currently learning about the latest tools and frameworks that contribute to automation and DevOps practices. Currently, I'm diving deep into containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes. Also, exploring infrastructure as code with Terraform and cloud technologies.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that leverage automation to streamline workflows, enhance DevOps practices, and simplify complex processes.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to send me a message here on GitHub or connect via email at your.email@example.com.
⚡ Fun fact: I'm a strong advocate for continuous learning and enjoy experimenting with new tech stacks in my free time. I also love spending time with my family, am passionate about physical activities, and enjoy traveling to beautiful beaches.
